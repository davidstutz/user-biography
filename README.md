# Wordpress Plugin: User Biography

A wordpress plugin aiming to provide a timeline-like user biography - users may add biographical parts over time which may then be displayed on the user's page in a timeline.

**Work in progress.**

## Usage

After activating the plugin, navigate to "Users" > "Your Profile". Below "About Yourself" you will find an additional section "Biography":

![Additional "Biography" section in "Your Profile".](screenshot.png?raw=true 'Additional "Biography" section in "Your Profile".')

The form allows to add so-called "Parts" to your biography.

In order to query these parts in your template, query for posts with type `ub_part`.
